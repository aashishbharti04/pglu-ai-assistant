# 🤖 Pglu AI Assistant

### A privacy-first, plugin-based desktop assistant — your own Jarvis, in Python

Talk or type to **open apps, search the web, answer questions, check your system, set timers,
take notes, and more.** Core features run on the **Python standard library alone** — voice and
system-info are optional extras. Local-first: no cloud brain, no API keys.

## 📖 Overview

Pglu AI Assistant is a real desktop assistant that controls your PC and answers your questions —
from a terminal, by **typing or speaking**. It uses a small **plugin "skill" architecture**: each
skill registers regex intents and a handler, so adding new abilities is a few lines. There's no
cloud LLM and no keys: knowledge comes from key-less public APIs (Wikipedia, Open-Meteo) and
everything else runs locally.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **Plugin skill architecture** — 6 skills, ~28 intents; add your own in a few lines
- 🗣️ **Voice *and* text** — speak (SpeechRecognition) and hear replies (pyttsx3), or just type
- 🖥️ **Real PC control** — launch apps (Notepad, Calculator, Settings, Task Manager, VS Code…), open sites
- 🔎 **Web** — Google / YouTube search, open any website
- 🧠 **Answers** — Wikipedia summaries (“who is…”, “what is…”), live **weather** for any city
- 🧮 **Math** — natural language (“what is 24 times 7”) via a safe AST evaluator (no `eval`)
- ⚙️ **System** — battery, CPU, RAM, disk, IP, system info (via `psutil` / stdlib)
- 📝 **Productivity** — notes and timers/reminders
- 🎲 **Fun** — jokes, coin flip, dice, random numbers, secure password generator
- 🩺 **`pglu doctor`** — environment & dependency health check
- 🔒 **Privacy-first & local** — no cloud brain, no API keys; key-less public APIs only
- 🪶 **Zero core dependencies** — extras (`voice`, `system`) are opt-in

## 🚀 Installation

Requires **Python 3.9+**. Pick whichever suits you:

**① Easiest — install the `pglu` command directly (no clone needed):**

```bash
pipx install "git+https://github.com/aashishbharti04/pglu-ai-assistant"   # isolated (recommended)
# or:
pip install "git+https://github.com/aashishbharti04/pglu-ai-assistant"
pglu "what is 25 times 4"      # now usable from anywhere
```

**② From PyPI** *(once published):*

```bash
pip install pglu-ai-assistant            # core
pip install "pglu-ai-assistant[full]"    # + voice + system info
pglu
```

**③ From source — for clone / fork / contributing:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashishbharti04/pglu-ai-assistant
cd pglu-ai-assistant
python main.py "what is 25 times 4"      # run without installing
pip install -e ".[full]"                 # editable install + all extras
```

> Add extras any time: `pip install "pglu-ai-assistant[voice]"` (mic/speech) or `[system]`
> (battery/CPU/RAM). On Linux, voice needs `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev` before PyAudio.

## 🖥️ Desktop app — clone & click an icon

Want a real desktop assistant with an icon you click whenever you need it? (Windows / macOS / Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashishbharti04/pglu-ai-assistant
cd pglu-ai-assistant
pip install -e .                  # optional but recommended

python -m pglu install-shortcut   # ➜ adds "Pglu AI Assistant" (with app icon) to your Desktop
```

Now **double-click “Pglu AI Assistant” on your Desktop** — a window opens where you **type (or 🎙️
speak)** your request and Pglu answers (and talks back, if you enabled voice). On Windows it launches
with `pythonw`, so there's **no black console window**.

Prefer to open the window directly? `python -m pglu gui` (or `pglu gui`, or the `pglu-gui` command).

## 🕹️ Usage (command line)

```bash
pglu                       # interactive text mode
pglu gui                   # open the desktop window
pglu install-shortcut      # add a clickable Desktop icon
pglu --voice               # interactive voice mode (needs [voice] extra)
pglu doctor                # environment & dependency check
pglu skills                # list everything Pglu can do
pglu "open notepad"        # one-shot command
python main.py "weather in Mumbai"   # without installing
```

### Things to say or type

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Apps | `open notepad` · `open calculator` · `launch task manager` · `open settings` |
| Web | `open youtube` · `open github.com` · `search for best laptops` · `youtube lofi beats` |
| Knowledge | `what time is it` · `what's the date` · `who is Ada Lovelace` · `what is gravity` |
| Weather | `weather in Delhi` |
| Math | `what is 24 times 7` · `calculate 100 divided by 4` |
| System | `battery` · `cpu usage` · `how much ram` · `disk space` · `my ip` · `system info` |
| Productivity | `take a note: buy milk` · `read my notes` · `set a timer for 5 minutes` |
| Fun | `tell me a joke` · `flip a coin` · `roll a dice` · `random number 1 to 100` · `generate a password 16` |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Settings live in `~/.pglu/config.json` (assistant name, user name, wake word, TTS rate, default
city). Notes are saved alongside it. Nothing is sent anywhere.

## 🧩 Adding a skill

Create a `Skill` subclass in `pglu/skills/`, register intents, and add it to `SKILL_CLASSES`:

```python
from .base import Skill

class Hello(Skill):
    name = "hello"
    def intents(self):
        return [(r"\bgreet me\b", self.greet)]
    def greet(self, text, m):
        return f"Hello, {self.ctx.config.user_name}!"
```

A handler returns a string (the reply) or `None` to let other intents try. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ❓ FAQ

**Does it need an API key or the internet?** No keys ever. Most features are offline; only
Wikipedia and weather make (key-less) web calls.

**Voice not working?** Install the `voice` extra and ensure a mic + PyAudio. Voice is optional —
typing always works.

**Is it safe?** Math uses a sandboxed AST evaluator (never `eval`); there are no secrets; system
control is limited to launching apps and reading stats.
